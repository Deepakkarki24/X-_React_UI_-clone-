A x(Twitter) clone UI in React, I have used most of the react important fundamentals like Props, State, Hooks and etc..
Break the application in different different component which will make this super smooth and fast

References which I am taking while creating this UI :-

1. Official X.com - twitter.com
2. React Officail Documentary - https://react.dev/learn
3. Ohter Documentary

Tools that I have used in this project :-

1. React js - obviously :)
2. Bootstrap 5
3. HTML, CSS - obviously\*2 :)

I have started this project on 29 jan 2024 - but not able to commit on git that's why I am start pushing the code to git from today 30 jan 2024.
