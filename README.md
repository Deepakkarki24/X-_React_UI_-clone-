A x(Twitter) clone UI in React, I have used most of the react important fundamentals like Props, State, Hooks and etc..
Break the application in different different component which will make this super smooth and fast.
Using Firebase for store and display the data from firebase firstore database.
Every important component has their own module css so that their is no missmatching or useless error.

1. Official X.com - twitter.com
2. React Officail Documentary - https://react.dev/learn
3. Firebase.com (Database refrence)
4. Ohter references (chatgpt & stackoverflow )

Tool stack that I have used in this project :-

1. React js
2. Bootstrap 5
3. HTML and CSS
4. Firebase(db)

I have started this project on 29 jan 2024 - but not able to commit on git that's why I am start pushing the code to git from today 30 jan 2024.
